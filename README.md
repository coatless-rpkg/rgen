`rgen` - C++ Headers for Sampling Distributions
===============================================

The repository houses a few random sampling routines that connect into *R*'s seed generation to be used with [`RcppArmadillo`](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo).

Supported Distributions
=======================

Presently, `rgen` provides an interface to:

-   dirichlet
-   multinomial
-   wishart
-   inverse wishart
-   multivariate normal
-   matrix normal
